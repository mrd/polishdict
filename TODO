* show verb conjungations when looking up a verb in --declension mode (in English it is labeled 'Conjugation', in Polish the word is still odmiana)
* It is possible that Declension or Conjugation occurs in other languages on the English site. Then the Polish anchor might become #Declension_2 or #Conjugation_2 (or higher number). So it is necessary to examine the English webpage to determine the correct anchor to use to link to those sections directly.
* Make sure to include the verb (im)perfective status, on the web it is shown after the word 'Verb' with the codes: pf or impf
* Show the diminutive form (shown on the web after the keyword 'diminutive' in the English site anyway)
* Actually show all of the pieces of info after the word, including gender, diminutive, augmentative, etc. On the English site, for example, for 'pies' there is: pies m animal (diminutive piesek, augmentative psisko, related adjective psi) 
* fuzzy search (esp. for polish letters)
* interpret &#...; codes in text mode into something sensible for text mode, or omit them entirely. In the printed declension table, also omit footnotes (e.g. numbers contained within brackets denoted by &#91; and &#93;) and make sure that &#47; becomes a forward slash.
